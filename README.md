# Car Silhouette Classifier

Project for Neural Networks course at Universidad Carlos 3 de Madrid in December of 2021. Programmed in python.

In this project we were handed a dataset with 846 instances and 14 variables per instance(wheel size, gas usage, etc...) that described a car. With this we had to be able to classify accordingly if the silhoutte of the car was an opel, van, saab or bus.

For doing this, we used a non-linear model, Multilayer Perceptron. We trained with 80% of the dataset and tested with the remaining 20%. We varied the learning rate, number of hidden layers and amount of neurons for each layer, and the number of cycles, until we achieved a model that presented 91% accuracy in classifying correctly the silhoutte a vehicle had.

Disclaimer: unfortunately I no longer have access to the dataset and can´t upload it, so the code can´t be executed.
